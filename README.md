# scrum-board
This is my biggest, though not first pet-project.

I decided to create this to accelerate workflow on future problems as it is described in Jeff Sutherland's book "SCRUM".

However back-end is already done (maybe needed some minor bug fixes), I am now aiming on developing solid front-end to make the service public to anyone.
