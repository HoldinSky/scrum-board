                Whole developing process of any product consists of equally divided spans of time - <span class="text-danger">sprints</span>,
                usually a couple of weeks, maximum - a month long, during which all attention is drawn to limited amount of tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each sprint has its own <span class="text-danger">backlog</span> that is filled with all the planned tasks.
                You can pick whatever task You want to then complete it. <b>Only one task can be picked at a time</b>,
                so no disturbing thoughts will overwhelm You. When the task is ready You should <b>manually</b> mark it as that.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-start fw-bold fs-2 my-3 ms-md-4 ms-2 text-decoration-underline">
            <p class="mt-3" id="boardConfiguration" style="color: var(--bs-cyan);">Board configuration</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-start fs-5 fw-normal text-dark ms-md-5 ms-3">
            <p>
                Before the work is started the sprint must be configured. In the <b>Configure board</b> section the duration of each sprint
                and start of the first one can be set.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition <b>Project's backlog</b> can be found there. The part that will hold <b>all the planned</b> features for the future project.
                Every new well-planned task should be placed here. Afterwards before the start of new sprint tasks must be manually picked
                to be placed in the backlog of the <b>sprint</b>. Although all uncompleted tasks of previous sprint automatically transfer to the next one.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-start fw-bold fs-2 my-3 ms-md-4 ms-2 text-decoration-underline">

        </div>
        <div class="text-start fs-5 fw-normal text-dark ms-md-5 ms-3">
            <p>
                While creating task in the project's backlog only its description must be set. However, when things come to the development
                before any task can be picked its <span class="text-danger">difficulty</span> must be set. It is recommended that
                the team set it by themselves based on everyone's opinion. Difficulty then will help to define team's <span class="text-danger">velocity</span>
                which measures average amount of tasks completed with different difficulties.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the task is chosen by developer, the requisites will be automatically attached to it, however it is possible to invite others to the group of
                responsible for the task as well as developer can join others on any task with the confirmation of those who are already busy with it.
                <span class="text-danger">Start</span> time of the task is set automatically as the moment of pressing the <b>Start</b> button on the task.
                The same goes with the <b>finish</b> of the task.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-start fw-bold fs-2 my-3 ms-md-4 ms-2 text-decoration-underline">
            <p class="mt-3" id="noSprintTask" style="color: var(--bs-cyan);">No-sprint tasks</p>

                If You do not belong to any developers team You still can use helpful part of the application in the section
                <span class="text-danger">no-sprint tasks</span>. It allows You to create Your own backlog of <b>todo list</b>
                and then work with it like with the team's board.
